NeuroStake: The North Pole Seed Vault for Human EEG Data

Preserving the Human Mind, Powering the Future of AI

Deep in the Arctic, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault safeguards the genetic foundation of life, ensuring the survival of plant species for future generations. NeuroStake is the digital equivalent—not for plants, but for the most intricate dataset in existence: the electrical signals of the human brain.

For the first time, we are building an immutable, cryptographically verifiable archive of human EEG data, preserving the raw signals of human cognition forever on the blockchain. This data—untouched, unmodifiable, and eternal—will walk through time and history, fueling AI breakthroughs, neuroscience discoveries, and the next era of brain-computer interfaces (BCI).

A Market for the Mind

Today, research institutions are the largest EEG data collectors. Their datasets hold the key to neurology, mental health, and cognitive AI, but a fundamental problem persists: there is no way to verify that an AI model was trained on the correct EEG dataset.

NeuroStake changes this. Instead of selling EEG data outright, institutions register and stake their datasets on the blockchain, proving authenticity while keeping the raw data private. AI companies, researchers, and individuals can purchase access, but instead of downloading data, they submit their AI models. The institution runs the computation locally and returns only the results—sealed with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) that guarantee the analysis was done on the correct, untampered dataset.

Buyers gain access to public features of the data—such as frequency spectrums, emotional markers, collection environments, and Fourier transform results—before submitting their models. This ensures transparency while preserving the privacy and security of raw EEG data.

This is more than a marketplace. This is a new model for AI training—one built on verifiability, integrity, and privacy.

Computation as a Service: A New Paradigm in AI Training

Unlike Bitcoin, where ownership is exclusive, data is non-exclusive—it can be used by multiple researchers for different models. This is why direct trading doesn’t work. Instead, NeuroStake transforms EEG data into a verifiable computation service.

Using EigenLayer staking, institutions lock collateral against their datasets. If they ever attempt fraud—by using incorrect EEG data or falsifying results—their stake is automatically slashed. This system removes trust from the equation: institutions must either be honest or face economic penalties.

This ensures that when a model is trained on EEG data, it is trained on the correct dataset—every single time.

The Future of Personal Neurodata Ownership

Right now, EEG data is owned by institutions, but the future belongs to individuals. As EEG headsets become more accessible, people will begin collecting their own brain activity, just as they track their heart rate or sleep patterns today.

When that day arrives, NeuroStake will be ready. Individuals will be able to stake, verify, and trade their own EEG data, contributing to AI research while maintaining full control over their neural information.

We look forward to that day—when biometric data lives on the blockchain, freely owned, staked, and traded by the very people who generate it.

NeuroStake Smart Contracts: Deployment & Verification

The core infrastructure is now live, ensuring EEG computations are verifiable, trustless, and economically secured.

🔹 Deploying contracts with account: 0x34202F7998ec478aAa1E4d8a152cF4b998355C69

✅ NeuroStake deployed at: 0xc71651f9146DC6174bA48dd0529cA24D25626e34
✅ ComputationRegistry deployed at: 0xFa406BddBC636504b9c9395Dc157b0242eCeee09
✅ PrivateEEGDataRegistry deployed at: 0x2176d8512361432F689b8cDddbCB3a9c70af130C

These contracts form the backbone of NeuroStake, ensuring that EEG computations are not just performed, but verifiably proven and economically enforced.

How It Works: Secure, Verifiable EEG Computation

1️⃣ Institutions Register & Stake EEG Data
	•	EEG data is hashed and stored on-chain.
	•	EigenLayer tokens are staked as collateral for security.

2️⃣ AI Buyers Submit Computation Requests
	•	Buyers request EEG-based AI training tasks.
	•	Payment is locked in a smart contract until verification is complete.

3️⃣ Institutions Execute Computation Locally
	•	Computation runs inside institutional servers.
	•	A ZK Proof is generated, proving correctness.

4️⃣ Results Are Verified & Payment is Released
	•	Gaia AVS checks if computation matches the registered EEG data.
	•	If valid, payment is released to the institution.
	•	If fraudulent, EigenLayer slashes the institution’s stake.

This mechanism removes the need for trust—AI researchers can verify that their models were trained on authentic, unstolen, and unaltered EEG data.

The Core Technology Behind NeuroStake

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs): Guarantees computations were done on the correct EEG dataset without revealing the data itself.
EigenLayer AVS Staking: Creates economic penalties for fraud, ensuring institutions cannot cheat.
Gaia AI Verification: AI-driven monitoring that detects anomalies and validates computations.
IPFS & Blockchain Storage: Immutable EEG data hashes stored on-chain, while full datasets remain off-chain for privacy.

📌 NeuroStake ensures that the future of brain data is decentralized, secure, and verifiable.

The Future of NeuroStake

AI is on the brink of merging with neuroscience, but data access and verification remain the biggest barriers. NeuroStake removes these barriers.

This is not just a protocol—it is the foundation for a new era of decentralized neurodata ownership. Institutions are already participating, and soon, individuals will, too.

A world where your brain activity is a digital asset, owned by you, traded securely, and fueling AI innovation is no longer a dream—it’s inevitable.

NeuroStake is the first step in that future. And that future starts now. 🚀
